# Support for the Toit framework

Welcome to Toit!

# Documentation

The [Toit docs](https://docs.toit.io) have lots of information. Some of it is
not applicable to the open-source variant, but a lot of sections are variant-neutral.

For example the [Language section](https://docs.toit.io/language) applies to the
close-source and open-source framework.

The libraries are documented in the [toitdocs](https://libs.toit.io/).

The toitdocs of [packages](https://pkg.toit.io/) can be found on their respective
package pages. Many packages also have an `example` folder.
